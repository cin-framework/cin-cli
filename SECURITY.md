## Security Measures

### Current Implementation

- **Configuration Security**: All configuration files are stored locally with appropriate permissions
- **Input Validation**: Command-line arguments are validated before processing
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
- **Update Mechanism**: Secure version checking against official GitHub releases

### Planned Enhancements

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ✦ Code Signing         → Digital signature validation   ║
║  ✦ Encrypted Config     → Configuration file encryption  ║
║  ✦ Audit Logging        → Security event tracking        ║
║  ✦ Permission Control   → Enhanced access controls       ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

## Known Limitations (Alpha Version)

- **Platform Support**: Currently limited to Windows 64-bit
- **Configuration**: Local storage without encryption
- **Network**: Basic HTTPS validation for update checks
- **Permissions**: Standard user-level permissions

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Download Only from Official Sources**
   - GitHub Releases: https://github.com/cin-framework/cin-cli/releases
   - Verify checksums when available

2. **Keep Updated**
   - Enable automatic update notifications
   - Install security patches promptly

3. **Secure Environment**
   - Run with minimal required permissions
   - Avoid running in shared environments

### For Developers

1. **Code Review**
   - All security-related changes require review
   - Follow secure coding practices

2. **Testing**
   - Security testing for each release
   - Vulnerability scanning

## Disclosure Policy

### Timeline

- **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
- **Day 1-2**: Initial response and acknowledgment
