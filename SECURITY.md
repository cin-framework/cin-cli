- **Input Validation**: Command-line arguments are validated before processing
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages
- **Update Mechanism**: Secure version checking against official GitHub releases

### Planned Enhancements

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  ✦ Code Signing         → Digital signature validation   ║
║  ✦ Encrypted Config     → Configuration file encryption  ║
║  ✦ Audit Logging        → Security event tracking        ║
║  ✦ Permission Control   → Enhanced access controls       ║
